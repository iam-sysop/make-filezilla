# Information and Helper Scripts for compilation of FileZilla
### **These guides are for cross-compiling FileZilla on WSL1/Debian and Windows 10**

This repo houses a couple guides to builduing FileZilla Client v3.5x+ and FileZilla Server v1.0.1x+.
I maintain this here for sake of ease of "version history" -- older versions of this guide will remain available based on the versions of FileZilla they are documented against.
As updates are made, tags will be added to the repository for version history. Every attempt to maintain accuracy and keep guides up to date will be made.  

## What's Here: 
[build-filezilla-client.md](https://github.com/thecarnie/make-filezilla/blob/main/build-filezilla-client.md) - For cross-compile of FileZilla Client v3.5x+  
[build-filezilla-server.md](https://github.com/thecarnie/make-filezilla/blob/main/build-filezilla-server.md) - For cross-compile of FileZilla Server v1.0.1x+  
[./patches](https://github.com/thecarnie/make-filezilla/blob/main/patches) - various patches for cross-compile - reference from above guides.  
[./scripts](https://github.com/thecarnie/make-filezilla/blob/main/scripts) - various shells scripts that match instructions from above guides (useful if you wish to semi-automate the process or build your own version often).
